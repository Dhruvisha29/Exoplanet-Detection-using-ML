# Exoplanet-Detection-using-ML
ðŸŒŒ Finding Exoplanets Using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning to classify whether an observation from NASAâ€™s Kepler Mission is a real exoplanet candidate or not.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Implemented and compared multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree.

Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using accuracy and performance metrics.

Built with Python and popular ML libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Developed a simple web interface (HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript) to showcase findings and explain how ML aids space exploration.

ðŸš€ Applications

Demonstrates how machine learning can assist in astrophysics and exoplanet discovery.

Serves as an example of applying classification algorithms to real-world scientific datasets.
